## Makefile ##

- To compile all programs,, execute: 
make all
- To clean the contents of unnecessary files, execute: 
make clean
- To run the tester, execute:
 make test

## Tester ##

The tester is located in the "tester" folder.
The tester program compares all of the above sort implementations in time and generates a chart.

1) tester.cxx - tester implementation that calls all sort implementations for n random operations:
n = 10,000, 20,000, 80,000, 160,000.
 Displays the execution time for each sort, then generates a graph showing visually, the time of sorting for n data. The chart will be in the graphs.pdf file

2) tester.hxx - contains all sort implementations and generator.

3) gnuplot.hxx - the class needed to generate a chart using the Gnuplot program.
